Slicers for Interactivity

To allow users to slice the dashboard and get more focused insights, the following slicers were added:
- **Region**
- **Segment**
- **Category**
- **Order Date** (filtered by Year or Month)

These allow dynamic filtering of all visuals based on user-selected criteria.
